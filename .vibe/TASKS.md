I would like to load the path /terminal, on the current host, inside of streamlit as an iframe. You can use the method that is followed in https://github.com/NeveIsa/streamlit-ttyd for handling the iframe (and size etc.), but I would like you to create this as a component embedded in the streamlit app directly. 

## Research [COMPLETED]
- ✅ Clone the project https://github.com/NeveIsa/streamlit-ttyd in .vibe/streamlit-ttyd, scan this project for insights and approaches. 
- ✅ Document your approach for a similar component that can be used in this streamlit app. 

## Development [COMPLETED]
- ✅ Add this component that embeds an iframe into streamlit app. Remove all of the current streamlit app before starting this work.  Outcome: user can interact with the terminal in the iframe, and it is responsive to the size of the streamlit app.

## Implementation Summary
- Replaced file manager app with terminal iframe component
- Terminal is embedded using Streamlit's native iframe component
- Points to /terminal/ endpoint (ttyd on port 7681)
- Includes responsive sizing with sidebar controls
- Height can be adjusted via slider or preset buttons
- Custom CSS for better visual integration
