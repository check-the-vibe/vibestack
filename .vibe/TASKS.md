# Outcome

## Research ✓
1. ✓ Iterate through .vibe/LINKS.csv, understand the available Ink components for install. 
2. ✓ Build a guide on how to connect tabs, forms, and ascii art images.
## Design ✓
1. ✓ Read the .vibe/docs/ux-flow.md doc, understand the steps, components, structure, and interlinking parts of each menu and stage in the customer journey
2. ✓ Create an implementation plan for each customer journey, document them in a new file in .vibe/docs/. 
3. ✓ Document in a new file in .vibe/docs/ the implementation steps of new components (like new llm clis). 
## Develop (In Progress)
1. ✓ Take the UX flow, implement each path sequentially. 
2. ⏳ Ensure that each implementation is placed in the Dockerfile/entrypoint/vibestack-welcome etc. scripts that are used to build the Docker image.
