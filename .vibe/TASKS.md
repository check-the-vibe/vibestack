## Outcome
I would like to move from the pyscreenrecorder solution, to one that launches an electron app (in the folder electron-clipboard) at boot, so that when a user accesses the VNC server they can see this application running.  Think through how to approcah this, flesh out the web research, design, and delivery you will need in order to accomplish this task. Write those tasks down in this file, then ask the user for permission to begin. 

### Research 
1. **Electron in Docker/Headless Environment**
   - [x] Research running Electron apps in Docker containers with X11
   - [x] Investigate Xvfb vs X11 forwarding for VNC display
   - [x] Check electron-clipboard app dependencies and --no-sandbox requirement

2. **VNC Display Configuration**  
   - [x] Determine correct DISPLAY variable for VNC server
   - [x] Research window manager requirements for Electron apps
   - [x] Check if additional X11 libraries needed in container

3. **Boot Process Integration**
   - [x] Review current supervisord.conf configuration
   - [x] Research supervisord environment variable passing
   - [x] Investigate proper startup order dependencies

### Design 
1. **Startup Architecture**
   - [x] Configure supervisord to launch Electron after VNC server
   - [x] Set DISPLAY=:0 (confirmed from existing setup)
   - [x] Pass ELECTRON_DISABLE_SANDBOX=1 environment variable
   - [x] Use custom boot.sh script as entry point

2. **Dependencies & Environment**
   - [x] Ensure nodejs and npm available at boot
   - [x] Configure PATH for electron-forge
   - [x] Set working directory to /workspaces/vibestack/electron-clipboard
   - [x] Handle missing node_modules (npm install if needed)

3. **Error Handling**
   - [x] Configure supervisord autorestart policy
   - [x] Add logging for debugging
   - [x] Handle electron crash scenarios

### Delivery
1. **Implementation Tasks**
   - [x] Remove pyscreenrec-mcp from supervisord.conf
   - [x] Add electron-clipboard supervisord configuration
   - [x] Create boot.sh script for handling npm install and startup
   - [x] Document required container rebuild
   
2. **Testing & Validation**
   - [ ] Verify Electron app launches successfully
   - [ ] Connect via VNC to confirm app visibility
   - [ ] Test clipboard functionality
   - [ ] Verify app restarts on crash
