# Claude Code Streaming Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The streaming implementation was hanging due to:
1. **Asyncio conflicts**: `asyncio.run()` creates a new event loop which conflicts with Streamlit's execution model
2. **SDK compatibility**: The claude-code-sdk has issues with async task cancellation when used in certain contexts
3. **ResultMessage parsing**: The SDK expects fields that may not exist in the CLI output

## Solution Implemented
Changed approach from using the Python SDK to directly calling the Claude CLI via subprocess:

### Key Changes:
1. **Direct CLI execution**: Uses `subprocess.Popen` to run Claude CLI directly
2. **Line-by-line parsing**: Reads stdout line by line for real-time updates
3. **Simple message detection**: Parses "Human:" and "Assistant:" prefixes
4. **Streaming display**: Updates UI as content arrives
5. **No async complexity**: Avoids asyncio entirely for better Streamlit compatibility

### Benefits:
- **True streaming**: Messages appear as they're generated
- **More reliable**: Avoids SDK compatibility issues
- **Better error handling**: Direct access to stderr for diagnostics
- **Simpler architecture**: No async-to-sync conversion needed

## Implementation Details

### CLI Command Structure:
```bash
claude \
  --no-color \
  --max-turns <N> \
  --permission-mode acceptEdits \
  --cwd /workspaces/vibestack \
  --allowed-tools Read,Write,Edit,Bash,TodoRead,TodoWrite \
  "<prompt>"
```

### Message Parsing Logic:
1. Detect message boundaries by prefixes
2. Accumulate content between boundaries
3. Display messages in real-time
4. Store complete messages in session state

## Files Updated
- `/home/vibe/streamlit/pages/6_ðŸ¤–_Claude_Code.py` - Main implementation
- `/workspaces/vibestack/streamlit_app/pages/6_ðŸ¤–_Claude_Code.py` - Docker context copy
- `/workspaces/vibestack/Dockerfile` - Added claude-code-sdk to pip install

## Testing Notes
The new implementation should:
- Start sessions without hanging
- Display messages as they arrive
- Handle errors gracefully
- Work within Streamlit's execution model

## Future Improvements
1. Better message parsing for tool use display
2. Progress indicators for long operations
3. Ability to interrupt running sessions
4. Better handling of multi-line code blocks
