# TASKS

Track the work planned or completed inside this session. Update it as you queue new jobs or finish steps so the workspace history stays clear.

- [ ] Capture any commands or scripts that should be replayed later
- [ ] Log blockers or dependencies discovered during the run
- [ ] Summarize results before closing the session

Feel free to expand this checklist to match your project.
