# AGENTS

This workspace is configured for Codex-driven automation. Use this document to capture agent context, constraints, and handoff notes while working inside the session.

## Suggested Sections
- **Objective** – What the agent is expected to accomplish
- **Key Constraints** – Environments, repos, or policies to respect
- **Resources** – Links to design docs, APIs, or credentials (avoid secrets)
- **Progress Log** – Short daily or per-run updates
- **Open Questions** – Items requiring review or escalation

Keep the content concise so follow-on sessions can pick up quickly.
